# Before Refactoring BookingController.php

1.Structure & Organization:

According to my Knowledge the original code had multiple responsibilities mixed within a single method. Several methods were too long, and yes logic was repeated unnecessarily.

2.Readability & Maintainability

The code was difficult to read due to long functions, lack of validation, and scattered logic.I have added Request::validate() in methods like store, acceptJobWithId, and distanceFeed

3.Logic Duplication:
Several instances of repeated logic (like isset checks and inline conditional assignments) were present.

4.Error Handling


# BookingRepository.php
I have refator some functions in this class (have not refactored the whole code of BookingRepository.php)

1. Dependency Injection: Injected Job, MailerInterface, and LoggerInterface in the constructor for better testability and maintainability.

2. Data Validation: Extracted validation logic into the validateBookingData() method to avoid duplication and centralize validation logic.
3. Code Readability: Improved variable names and method names for better clarity and understanding.
4. Error Handling: Added explicit error handling and validation for missing fields in booking data.
